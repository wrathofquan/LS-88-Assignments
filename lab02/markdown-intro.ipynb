    "Markdown is an integral feature of Jupyter Notebooks; it is a formatting language that allows you to create rich (that is, stylized) text. Jupyter supports Github flavored Markdown, which has some nice features like HTML output and syntax highlighting (we'll get to those later). Markdown is based on HTML (HyperText Markup Language, the language that webpages are written in) and is widely used across domains. It is an integral part of Jupyter notebooks, and it is in Markdown that we write the narrative that connects hard-to-follow code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll go through an introduction to Markdown, beyond the simple rich text that it will let you create, and cover some of its more interesting characteristics. In particular, we'll cover things like code blocks, tables, embedding HTML, and other cool features. You don't need to know HTML for this lab, but you will be taught two tags (`div` and `img`) as well as HTML id's.\n",

    "| `1.` | Ordered list | `<ol>`, `<li>` |\n",
    "| `* ` | Unordered list | `<ul`, `<li>` |\n",
    "| `#` | Headings | `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ... |\n",
    "| `---` | Line | N/A |\n",
    "\n",
    "To get literal characters such as \\_ and \\*, append a `\\` to the beginning of each: `\\_` or `\\*`. Using the hyperlink syntax, you link either to external webpages or to local files. For example, to link to the [test.pdf file](./test.pdf) in this directory, you would write `[test.pdf file](./test.pdf)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create nested lists, you indent the line with the sublist element. You can also mix ordered and unordered lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "* List 1\n",
    "    * Sublist 1\n",
    "        * Subsublist 1\n",
    "        * Subsublist 2\n",
    "    * Sublist 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List 1\n",
    "    1. Sublist 1\n",
    "        * Subsublist 1\n",

    "        * Subsublist 2\n",
    "    2. Sublist 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you make a list (either ordered or unordered), you need to leave a blank line between the last item and the start of your next paragraph, otherwise Markdown will render the next paragraph on the same line or with the same indentation. For example:\n",

    "As you probably have noticed by now, we can write syntax in Markdown that generates text which looks like code. There are two ways to do this: inline code, and block code. Inline code appears within regular text, and is generated by surrounding text with backticks, `` ` ``. It does _not_ support syntax highlighting. In code blocks, the code is set aside from the text in a new paragraph. This is generated by wrapping the code block with three backticks. In Github flavored Markdown (which is what is in Jupyter Notebooks), this also allows you to use syntax highlighting. (Ever notice how in code cells some words are different colors or styles? That's syntax highlighting.) To make use of this feature, write the name of the language right after the backticks on the first line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(x):\n",

    "\n",
    "Markdown also supports inline and block LaTeX, which is a language that renders mathematical expressions. For inline LaTeX, wrap the code in `$`. For block LaTeX, wrap in double dollar signs, `$$`. (To use literal \\\\$ characters in text, append `\\\\` to the beginning of each:  `\\\\$`.) We won't get into the nitty gritty of LaTeX commands; if you need help, there are some LaTeX code generators out there, such as [this one](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php). As an example of LaTeX, here is a wonderful expression; it is the Ramanujan approximation of $\\frac{1}{\\pi}$:\n",

    "<img src=\"path/to/image\" />\n",

    "```\n",
    "Unfortunately, Jupyter Notebooks will not render images if you resize them using Markdown resizing syntax; in Jupyter, if you want an image to be a specific size, you need to use HTML syntax. For HTML, you add the `width` and `height` elements to the `img` tag:\n",
