    "\n",
    "In this L&S 88 lab, we will explore the Jupyter environment and think about questions of reproducibility. As we discussed this week and last week, reproducibility is one of the most important aspects of data science; further, we talked about how annotating code and displaying results in a format that makes it accessible and which allows others to use different technologies to recreate your process is of paramount importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we will be taking these ideas and applying them to a dataset that has had some work done on it already. In this notebook, we have loaded a data set that contains information about movies. This notebook contains code that _cleans_ the data; that is, it puts it into a format that can be used to answer a data-driven question. **Your assignment will be to fill in the Markdown cells in this notebook so that the code in each cell has an explanation for its methodology.** In order to help you with this, we will provide you with the question that we are using the data set to answer:\n",

    "### The Question\n",
    "The first part of developing a data-driven project is to decide what question you want to answer. The question needs to be specific, and it needs to be something you can develop a step-by-step approach for. With this notebook, I am going to use the `movies` Table to answer the following question:\n",
    "> Can we predict the genre of a movie based on its synopsis?\n",
    "\n",
    "It will take a few steps to answer this question. The main methodology will be to create a test set and determine the frequency of different words in synopses within different genres, and then develop a $k$-nearest neighbors classifier based on this information. The over-arching workflow will look something like this:\n",
    "1. Data preprocessing\n",
    "2. Group movies by genre and look for recurring words in plots\n",
    "3. Write a $k$-nearest neighbor classifier\n",
    "4. Test the classifier and determine its accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "These blocks tell Python to attempt the `<try_expression>` and if the error `<error>` is thrown, then to execute the `<error_expression>`. Below is a quick example of how these are used. In the first block, `x` is not defined, so a `NameError` is thrown, resulting in the `except` statement being run. In between the blocks, `x` is defined, so when the second block runs, the value assigned to `x` will be printed and, since no error is thrown, the `except` statement is not run."
